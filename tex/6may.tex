The Number Theory Exam of The National Camp.
Problems are given below:
\begin{prob}\label{nt:1}
Let $N$ be an integer. Given any $a, b$ such that $\gcd(a, b, N) = 1$. Prove
that you can find $m, n$ such that $(m, n) = 1$ and $N\mid m - a, N\mid n - b$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}\label{nt:2}
Let $p$ be a prime number. We call a subset $S$ of $\{1, 2, \ldots , p - 1\}$
“good” if it satisfies the property that for every $x, y \in S$, $xy \pmod p$ is also in $S$.
How many “good” sets are there?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}\label{nt:3}
Let $P(x)$ be a nonzero integer polynomial, that is, the coefficients
are all integers. We call a prime $q$ “interesting” if there exists some natural
number $n$ for which $q|2^n + P(n)$. Prove that there exist infinitely many “iner-
esting” primes.
\end{prob}
