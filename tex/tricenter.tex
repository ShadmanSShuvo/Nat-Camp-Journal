Today's topic is about basic triangle centers like circumcenter, centroid, incenter, excenter, orhtocenter, etc\ldots (This is mostly Angle Chasing in a TRIANGLE)



\section{Circumcenter}
I think, you are familiar with the circumcenter. It is the center of the circle which goes through the points $A,B,C$ of $\triangle ABC$. It is determined by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments.

\begin{figure}[ht] 
\centering
	\includegraphics{circum.pdf}
\caption{Circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\)}
\end{figure}
The proof of concurrency is very easy. Just remember that any point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant from two of the corresponding vertex. 
%He showed the proof of concurrency of the perpendicular bisector of the sides of a triangle. I am not going to include the proof as you can find it in anywhere. 

\section{Centroid}

Centroid is the intersection of the medians of a triangle. It is defined by \(G\). It is also called Center of Mass or Center of Gravity.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{centroid.pdf}
\caption{Centroid of \(\triangle ABC\)}
\end{figure}


Here we are going to see a combinatorial proof!

Let, three centroid don't concur, then they intersect in three pints let \(G_1,G_2,G_3\). Let 
the midpoints of the sides are \(L,M,N\). Then draw the medians of the triangle \(LMN\) then, 
their medians intersect at \(G_1,G_2,G_3\) as \(MN\parallel BC\). So we are going to infinite 
descent, and consider the median triangle of \(LMN\). Consequently, the areas of the median 
triangles are going to \(0\). But the area of triangle \(G_1G_2G_3\) remains same. which means 
triangle \(G_1G_2G_3\) is bigger that the original triangle which is a contradiction. So 
centroid exists. 


\section{Orthocenter}

Let \(D,E,F\) be the foot of the perpendicular from \(A,B,C\) to the opposite side of the 
triangle. Then \(BFEC\) is a cyclic quadrilateral(You can see this by \(\angle FEA = B\) or by 
\(\angle BFC = \angle BEC =90\dg\)). Also there are another two cyclic quadrilaterals. Find them.


\begin{figure}[ht]

\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}[t]{6.5cm}
		\includegraphics{ortho.pdf}
	\\ \centering \sffamily Orthocenter of \(\triangle ABC\)
	\end{minipage}
		\quad
	\begin{minipage}[t]{6.5cm}
		\includegraphics{ortho-reflect.pdf}
	\\ \centering \sffamily Reflection of Orthocenter lies on Circumcirlce
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}	
\caption{Ortocenter and its Reflections}
\end{figure}

There are six cyclic quadrilaterals and the orthocenter is the incenter of the orthic trinagle.


\begin{figure}[ht] 
\centering
		\includegraphics{ortho-6cyclic.pdf}
\caption{Orthocenter and 6 cyclic quadrilaterals}
\end{figure}

Then Mentor taught us the reflection of the orthocenter across the sides and about the midpoint of the sides lie on the circumcircle of the triangle \(ABC\). 
Let the reflection of \(H\) across the side \(BC\) is \(X\) then we are going to show that \(X\) lies on \((ABC)\). 

Note that \(\triangle BDH \cong \triangle BDX\) by some angle chasing.

So, \(\angle BXH = \angle BHD = \angle ACB\) and therefore \(ABXC\) is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Let the reflection of H acroos the midpoint of \(BC\) is \(Y\).
Then, \[\angle BAH = \angle CAO=90\dg - B.\]
and \(AY\) is a diameter.

\(BH=CY\) hence, \(BH\parallel CY\) thererfore, \(BHCY\) is a parallelogram, and \(H,L,Y\) are collinear. hence \(Y\) lies on \((ABC)\).




\section{Nine Point Circle}
Our current topic is the famous Nine-Point Circle whih goes through exactly nine points.

These pints are three midpoints, three feet of the perpendicular and the three midpoints of \(AH,BH,CH\).

Now we are going to show the first six points are concyclic.
%npc
\begin{figure}[ht] 
\centering
		\includegraphics{npc-proof.pdf}
\caption{\(D,L,M,N\) lie on a circle}
\end{figure}
\(D\) is the reflection of \(A\) across \(MN\)
so \(\angle MDN = A\) we also know that \(\angle MLN = A\) so \(L,M,N,D\) are concyclic . Similarly we can show that \(L,M,N,E\) and \(L,M,N,F\) are concyclic, so all six points are concyclic.
Other proof \(\angle BDN = \angle NML\) so \(L,M,N,D\) are concyclic points.


Now we are gonna prove that \(K\) the midpoint of \(AH\) lies on \((DEFLMN)\). 
\(\angle NLB = C \) so we have to show that \(\angle NKH = C\). but \[ \angle NKH= \angle BHD = C\] so we are done.

Also \(N_9\) the center of the Nine-Point Circle is the midpoint of \(OH\) where \(O\) and \(H\) are circumcenter and Orthocenter respectively.
