\section{Definitions}
A \textbf{Recurrence} sequence is a type of sequence where the following terms of the sequence depends on the previous terms of the sequence.

$$A_n=A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}-3A_{n-3}$$ is a recurrence relation where every term depends on it previous three terms.

A \textbf{linearly recurrence sequence} is a recurrence where the relation with the following term and the previous terms is linear(or has a power of 1). The previously mentioned recurrence sequence is a linear recurrence sequence.

The common structure of a \textbf{homogeneous linearly recurrence sequence} is $$T_n=C_1T_{n-1}+C_2T_{n-2}+C_3T_{n-3}+...+C_{k-1}T_{n-k+1}+C_kT_{n-k}$$, where $k$ is a positive integer less than $n$ and greater than $0$.

\section{Solving Recurrence}
\begin{example}
Solve the recurrence $$T_n=5T_{n-1}-6T_{n-2}$$
\end{example}
$$T_n=C_1T_{n-1}+C_2T_{n-2}+C_3T_{n-3}+...+C_{k-1}T_{n-k+1}+C_kT_{n-k}$$ here, the \textbf{order} of this recurrence is $k$.

So, in our following problem, the order is 2.

To, solve the recurrence, first we have the find the \textbf{characteristic polynomial} of the recurrence.

The characteristic polynomial of $$T_n=C_1T_{n-1}+C_2T_{n-2}+C_3T_{n-3}+...+C_{k-1}T_{n-k+1}+C_kT_{n-k}$$ would be $$x^k-c_1x^{k-1}-c_2x^{k-2}-....-c_kx^{0}=0$$
